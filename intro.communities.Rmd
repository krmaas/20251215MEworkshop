#Why are we here?

 - Microbes control everything!^*
 - We can!

#Other Genes for Other taxonomic groups

- ITS(1/2)
    - Internal Transcribed Spacer
    - ITS2 common for fungi
    - Primers in 5S and 28S (very conserved)
    - UNITE2 database

#Other Genes for Other taxonomic groups

- CO1 
    - Mitochondial
    - Probably works for most animals and many seed plants (possibly fungi)
    - Each major group needs their own primers (and database?)
    - BOLD/MIDORI2/??? databases within groups

#Why are we here?


 - What to do with MB-GB of sequencing data?
    - Great there are programs!
    - Oh they're only command line
 - How to make sense of complex communities?
    - Multivariate
    - Non-linear
    - Non-normal
    - Independent variables?

----

#Why are we here?

- Command line
    - Learning curve
    - Customization
    - Learning curve

- **Reproducible Research**

----

#Reproducible Research

- Document process so it can be replicated
- Enable collaborative analysis
- Reduce time repeating analyses

 - Your most important collaborator is yourself 3 months ago and that collaborator doesn't answer emails.
